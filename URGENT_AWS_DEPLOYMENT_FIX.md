# 🚨 URGENT: AWS Server Module Resolution Fix

## Problem Solved ✅
The module resolution error on your AWS server has been diagnosed and fixed. The issue was TypeScript path aliases (`@/controllers/auth.controller`) not being resolved to relative paths in the compiled JavaScript files.

## 🔧 AWS Server Fix Commands

**Run these commands on your AWS server to fix the login issue immediately:**

### Step 1: Connect and Navigate
```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-aws-server-ip
cd /home/ubuntu/inventario/inventory-app/backend
```

### Step 2: Stop PM2 and Clean
```bash
pm2 stop backend
pm2 delete backend
rm -rf dist/
```

### Step 3: Pull Latest Fixes
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies & Build
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

You should see output like:
```
🔧 Fixing TypeScript path aliases in compiled files...
✅ Fixed: dist/routes/auth.routes.js
✅ Fixed: dist/routes/components.routes.js
✅ Fixed: dist/routes/movements.routes.js
✅ Fixed: dist/routes/recipes.routes.js

✅ Path fix completed. Processed 22 files.
🚀 You can now start the server with: npm start
```

### Step 5: Start PM2
```bash
pm2 start dist/index-simple.js --name "backend"
```

### Step 6: Verify Fix
```bash
pm2 logs backend --lines 20
```

You should NOT see module resolution errors anymore.

## 🧪 Test Login Functionality

### Test 1: Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### Test 2: Login Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "your-username", "password": "your-password"}'
```

If successful, you'll get a response with a JWT token.

### Test 3: Frontend Access
Open your frontend application and try to log in through the UI.

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

1. **Path Alias Resolution**: Created `fix-paths.js` script that converts:
   ```javascript
   // FROM (broken):
   const auth_controller_1 = require("@/controllers/auth.controller");
   
   // TO (working):
   const auth_controller_1 = require("../controllers/auth.controller");
   ```

2. **Build Process**: Updated `package.json` build script to use the path fixer instead of `tsc-alias`

3. **TypeScript Issues**: Fixed unused parameter warnings that prevented compilation

## 📊 Expected Results After Fix

✅ **Server Starts Successfully**: No more "Cannot find module" errors  
✅ **Login Works**: Authentication endpoints respond correctly  
✅ **Frontend Functions**: Login page allows user access  
✅ **Movement API**: Price update functionality works as expected  
✅ **PM2 Stability**: No more unstable restarts  

## 🚨 If You Still Have Issues

### Alternative Manual Fix (Emergency Use Only):
If the automated fix doesn't work, manually run:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/inventario/inventory-app/backend
find dist/ -name "*.js" -exec sed -i 's|require("@/|require("../|g' {} \;
find dist/ -name "*.js" -exec sed -i 's|from "@/|from "../|g' {} \;
pm2 restart backend
```

### Check Environment Variables:
Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
DATABASE_PATH=/home/ubuntu/inventario/inventory-app/backend/inventory.db
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-here
```

## 🎉 Success Verification

After applying the fix, you should be able to:
1. ✅ Log into the application
2. ✅ Create movements with price updates  
3. ✅ Use all existing functionality
4. ✅ See stable PM2 logs without errors

**🕐 Time to Fix**: ~5 minutes  
**💡 Priority**: CRITICAL - Required for login functionality

The fix has been tested locally and all path aliases are properly resolved. Your AWS server should work perfectly after applying these steps.
